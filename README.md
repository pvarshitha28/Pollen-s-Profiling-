# **Pollen's Profiling: Automated Classification of Pollen Grains**

"Pollen's Profiling: Automated Classification of Pollen Grains" is an innovative project aimed at demonstrating the automated classification of pollen grains using advanced image processing and machine learning techniques. This application provides a web interface for users to upload microscopic pollen grain sample images, which are then processed by a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to identify the pollen type.

## **Features**

* **Image Upload**: Easily upload microscopic pollen grain sample images through a user-friendly web interface.  
* **Image Preview**: See a preview of the uploaded image before classification.  
* **Pollen Classification**: The Flask backend utilizes a CNN model for the identification of pollen grain types.  
* **Responsive Design**: The web interface is designed using Tailwind CSS for optimal viewing on various devices.

## **Technology Stack**

* **Backend**: Flask (Python web framework)  
* **Frontend**: HTML, CSS (Tailwind CSS), JavaScript  
* **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow and Keras (for CNN model definition and loading)  
* **Image Processing**: Pillow (PIL \- Python Imaging Library)

## **Setup Instructions**

Follow these steps to get the Pollen Grain Classifier up and running on your local machine.

### **1\. Clone the Repository (or create files manually)**

First, create a project directory:  
mkdir pollen\_classifier\_flask  
cd pollen\_classifier\_flask

Then, manually create the app.py, train\_model.py, requirements.txt, and templates/index.html files within this directory, copying the content provided in the respective code blocks. Ensure you also create the dataset and templates subdirectories.  
Create requirements.txt:  
Create a file named requirements.txt in the pollen\_classifier\_flask directory with the following content:  
Flask  
Pillow  
tensorflow

### **2\. Install Dependencies**

You'll need Python 3 installed. Navigate to your project directory in the terminal and install the required Python packages using the requirements.txt file:  
pip install \-r requirements.txt

### **3\. Train and Save the CNN Model**

Before running the Flask application, you need to train and save your CNN model. This step runs the train\_model.py script. **Ensure your dataset folder is populated with your pollen grain images organized by class.**  
python train\_model.py

This script will define the CNN architecture, load your training data, train the model, and save it as pollen\_classifier\_model.h5.

### **4\. Run the Flask Application**

After the model has been trained and saved, you can start the Flask server:  
python app.py

The terminal will show output similar to: \* Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

## **Usage**

1. **Open in Browser**: Open your web browser and navigate to http://127.0.0.1:5000/.  
2. **Upload Image**: Click the "Upload Pollen Image" button and select an image file (e.g., a .jpg or .png) of a pollen grain sample. An image preview will appear.  
3. **Identify Pollen Type**: Click the "Identify Pollen Type" button.  
4. **View Result**: The application will display the classified pollen type.

## **Future Enhancements**

To further enhance this pollen grain classifier, consider the following:

* **Advanced CNN Architectures**: Experiment with more complex and pre-trained CNN models (e.g., ResNet, Inception, VGG) for better performance through transfer learning.  
* **Data Augmentation**: Implement more sophisticated data augmentation techniques during training to improve model generalization.  
* **Model Evaluation Metrics**: Add more detailed model evaluation (precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix) after training.  
* **User Feedback Loop**: Implement a mechanism for users to provide feedback on classification accuracy to potentially retrain and improve the model over time.  
* **Confidence Scores**: Display the prediction confidence score alongside the predicted pollen type.
